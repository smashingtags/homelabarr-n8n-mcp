  - Fixed 9 MCP tools that were failing with full package names:
    - `get_node_info`, `get_node_essentials`, `get_node_as_tool_info`
    - `search_node_properties`, `validate_node_minimal`, `validate_node_config`
    - `get_property_dependencies`, `search_nodes`, `get_node_documentation`
  - Maintains backward compatibility - existing short prefixes continue to work
  - Created centralized `normalizeNodeType` utility for consistent handling across all tools
- **Health check endpoint** - Fixed incorrect `/health` endpoint usage
  - Now correctly uses `/healthz` endpoint which is available on all n8n instances
  - Improved error handling with proper fallback to workflow list endpoint
  - Fixed axios import for healthz endpoint access
- **n8n_list_workflows pagination clarity** (Issue #54)
  - Changed misleading `total` field to `returned` to clarify it's the count of items in current page
  - Added `hasMore` boolean flag for clear pagination indication
  - Added `_note` field with guidance when more data is available ("More workflows available. Use cursor to get next page.")
  - Applied same improvements to `n8n_list_executions` for consistency
  - AI agents now correctly understand they need to use pagination instead of assuming limited total workflows

### Added
- **Node type utilities** in `src/utils/node-utils.ts`
  - `normalizeNodeType()` - Converts full package names to database format
  - `getNodeTypeAlternatives()` - Provides fallback options for edge cases
  - `getWorkflowNodeType()` - Constructs proper n8n workflow format from database values
- **workflowNodeType field** in all MCP tool responses that return node information
  - AI agents now receive both `nodeType` (internal format) and `workflowNodeType` (n8n format)
  - Example: `nodeType: "nodes-base.webhook"`, `workflowNodeType: "n8n-nodes-base.webhook"`
  - Prevents confusion where AI agents would search nodes and use wrong format in workflows
  - Added to: `search_nodes`, `get_node_info`, `get_node_essentials`, `get_node_as_tool_info`, `validate_node_operation`
- **Version information in health check**
  - `n8n_health_check` now returns MCP version and supported n8n version
  - Added `mcpVersion`, `supportedN8nVersion`, and `versionNote` fields
  - Includes instructions for AI agents to inform users about version compatibility
  - Note: n8n API currently doesn't expose instance version, so manual verification is required

### Performance
- **n8n_list_workflows response size optimization**
  - Tool now returns only minimal metadata (id, name, active, dates, tags, nodeCount) instead of full workflow structure
  - Reduced response size by ~95% - from potentially thousands of tokens per workflow to ~10 tokens
  - Eliminated token limit errors when listing workflows with many nodes
  - Updated tool description to clarify it returns "minimal metadata only"
  - Users should use `n8n_get_workflow` to fetch full workflow details when needed

## [2.7.17] - 2025-07-17

### Fixed
- **Removed faulty auto-generated examples from MCP tools** (Issue #60)
  - Removed examples from `get_node_essentials` responses that were misleading AI agents
  - Removed examples from `validate_node_operation` when validation errors occur
  - Examples were showing incorrect configurations (e.g., Slack showing "channel" property instead of required "select" property)
  - Tools now focus on validation errors and fix suggestions instead of potentially incorrect examples
  - Preserved helpful format hints in `get_node_for_task` (these show input formats like "#general" or URL examples, not node configurations)
  - This change reduces confusion and helps AI agents build correct workflows on the first attempt

### Changed
- Updated tool documentation to reflect removal of auto-generated examples
- `get_node_essentials` now points users to `validate_node_operation` for working configurations
- Enhanced validation error messages to be more helpful without relying on examples
